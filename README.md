## Concept
Goals:
+ Inspired by the growth of beginners on discord ps communities, I am setting out to create a discord bot that can hopeful be a useful resource especially regarding repetitive questions/links.
+ While the project will start out slightly focused on beginners, I hope to in the future expand this to be able to benefit as much of the community as possible

Planned Functionality:
+ Within the long run I would like to have this bot to decrease the need for research and repetition of basic questions. This will hopefully also decrease the research process.

## S T A T U S !
+ Functionality: Working
+ Development: Early Stages
+ Finished: Basics of a discord bot, Couple test commands
+ Tasks: Like everything (will probably make a public trello page)
