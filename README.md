> NOTE: I WILL ONLY RELEASE THE BOT INVITE LINK LATER ON WHEN I'M A BIT MORE AHEAD WITH THE DEVELOPMENT

## C O N C E P T
### Goal:
+ Inspired by the growth of beginners on discord ps communities, I am setting out to create a discord bot that can hopeful be a useful resource especially regarding repetitive questions/links.
+ While the project will start out slightly focused on beginners, I hope to expand this to be able to benefit as much of the community as possible in the future.

### Planned Functionality:
+ Within the long run I would like to have this bot be able to decrease the need for research and repetition of basic questions, being able to provide resources and answers in the discord channels immediately.
+ The idea is to increase the convenience for the discord pen spinning communities. This is intended to become a simple mean for searching through Discord.
+ Hopefully the bot will also include essential information for both tricks and mods through database integration.

### Methods of Contribution:
1. Providing suggestions for new ideas
2. Exposing issues with old implementations
3. As if currently I don't require any help with the actual bot's code *(unless you're that good then sure join in)* but I'm looking forward to adding short descriptions or responses to certain commands to elaborate on the detail. Therefore any ps writers that would like to help with this are free to contact me.
4. Commenting on the last points the bot code will be updated each time progress is made so while I'm not specifically looking for help creating the code you are free to point out and even add pull requests or issues on the repo itself.
5. If you would like to help moderate over the project through boring stuff like updating posts or pages regarding this then again you can contact me but know that I'll be less welcoming with this role as it can be easily covered up for.

### Contact:
1. To contact me you can ping me in the testing server or dm me on Discord, Instagram, or Twitter.
2. For the fastest reply use discord but others shouldn't be too bad.
3. Messaging or pinging me once is enough, I know I don't have a life but still.
4. Adding on to the previous point please only contact me through only one form of media, there is no need for you to message me in every single way possible.
5. For inquiries related to this you can contact me through the following:
